### 3D-Printable Mounting Plate for dumbpad
Mounting plates designed for dumbpad v1.x ([dumbpad by imchipwood](https://github.com/imchipwood/dumbpad/)); fits in the case designed by Anthony @ [customkbd.com.au](https://customkbd.com.au/)

Ideal for turning dumbpad into a hotswappable macropad.

I am new to 3D printing and 3D modelling, and this is my first even model. Please be forgiving and feel free to point out any inappropriates in my design. PR's are welcomed too.
