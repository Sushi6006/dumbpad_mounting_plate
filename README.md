## 3D-Printable Mounting Plate for dumbpad
Mounting plates designed for dumbpad v1.x ([dumbpad by imchipwood](https://github.com/imchipwood/dumbpad/)); fits in the case designed by Anthony @ [customkbd.com.au](https://customkbd.com.au/)

I found out that the hot-swap sockets I soldered in cannot hold switches firmly enough, and plates were needed. Hence, I started this project.

I am new to 3D printing and 3D modelling, and this is my first ever model. Please be forgiving and feel free to point out any inappropriates in my design. PR's are welcomed too.
